## Documentation

The repo contains a few Playwright tests with one test that always fails (intentionally). The example configuration files use [Matrix Execution Strategy](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/using-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions#jobsjob_idstrategymatrix) to run 3 containers for parallelization.

To reproduce the setup:

- Create an organization, get your **Record Key** and **Project Id** at https://app.currents.dev
- Set [GitHub secret variable](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/reference/encrypted-secrets) `CURRENTS_RECORD_KEY`.

See the example GH Actions configuration:

- [test-basic-pwc.yml](.github/workflows/test-basic-pwc.yml)
- [test-basic-reporter.yml](.github/workflows/test-basic-reporter.yml)
